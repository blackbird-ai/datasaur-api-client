To all appearances The Little Prince is a children’s book. But ever since its original publication in French in 1943, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s story has enchanted audiences of all ages. The book’s beloved hero is a small, blond-haired boy from asteroid B-612, which he leaves to journey across the galaxy. Along his way, he visits a number of planets each populated by a sole person with an absurd profession (the little prince ultimately learns that there is no other kind). When he lands on Earth, in the middle of the desert, he is met by a mysterious snake. “Where are all the people?” the little prince asks. “I’m beginning to feel lonely in this desert.” “You can feel lonely among people, too,” replies the snake.


However elusive the story’s meaning, few have matched the universality of its appeal. In April 2017, The Little Prince became the most translated book in the world, excluding religious texts (which enjoyed significant head starts). It now exists in 300 languages, a sum that doesn’t even include the range of translations within languages. In Korean, there are said to be about 50 different versions. Until recently, English could claim only a meagre six. Now, Michael Morpurgo, master storyteller and untested translator, has delivered a definitive seventh.
