Sherlock Holmes become widely popular in 1891. His popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with "A Scandal in Bohemia". All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.
